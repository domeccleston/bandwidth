What do I want to do?

I want to check which network requests are made when the browser requests a certain webpage.

Probably the easiest way to do this is in Webdriver or Puppeteer. I'm 
confident I can do it that way. 

I can't see how I can be sure to capture all the correct requests if I 
don't do this using a browser, even though browser automation is a 
slightly clunky way to go about it.
